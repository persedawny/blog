                            Medusa is possibly one of the most famous figures in Greek mythology.
                            Her snake hair and the power to turn people to stone is still widely used in stories and movies, which don't even have to have anything to do with mythology.<br>
                            Depictions of her are even used to keep other bad things away. A bit like all the devils that we put on our churches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, for a lot of people their knowledge about who Medusa was doesn't go any further than a Gorgon who gets killed by Perseus..<br>
                            Who was she? Why was she turned into a Gorgon? You see, this lack of information might have a very easy cause. It's because Medusa has several origin stories!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In many of the early Greek stories, Medusa is one of the 3 Gorgon sisters (the other two being Stheno and Euryale).
                            All 3 were daughters of the sea monster Ceto and the sea god Phorcys. She was a monster from her beginning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later, in the later Greek and Roman times, Medusa became more feminine. One of the more famous Roman stories even made her a beautiful princess of Athens (thanks Ovid, really cool).<br>
                            We will continue further on this version of Medusa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a normal day for Medusa. She had come to the temple to praise the city's goddess, Athena.<br>
                            Athena had won the contest to name, and become the most important god of the city from Poseidon. And, let's say the later of the two still didn't take it very well.<br>
                            This was his time for revenge on Athena. He assaulted one of Athena's most beloved priestesses, as Medusa tried to plead for forgiveness and help from her goddess.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Athena however, didn't come to help her. As the virgin goddess she was disgusted by what was happening in her temple.<br>
                            And you know, since it’s mythology, of course the woman gets the blame (also because Poseidon was an older and far stronger god than Athena). So Athena turned the once beautiful Medusa into the Gorgon we all know and love.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this version Pegasus and Chrysaor, the children that burst out of Medusa’s neck(!!!) once Perseus kills her, are a result of Poseidon assaulting her.<br>
                            This version also makes Perseus killing Medusa a way heavier story to read, since she’s just a princess that was turned into a monster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some people see Athena turning Medusa into a monster as an act of kindness, since she wouldn’t be followed by men or gods anymore and she even got a way to defend herself; she could turn people into stone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After Perseus returned Medusa’s head, it was placed in Athena’s shield. Where it appears in most visual representations of Athena (I guess Athena did like her in the end).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Some depictions of Medusa in games:</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Smite:</b><br>
                            Medusa is one of the many, MANY mythological characters that are playable in the moba Smite. Smite gives you the more dramatic backstory, her being a normal human until she got assaulted by Poseidon, and equip her with a mask. With her ultimate ability she takes of her mask to show her true face, stunning those who look at her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>League of Legends:</b><br>
                            Cassiopeia once was the youngest and most beautiful daughter of one of the noble houses of Noxus.<br>
                            In search for power, she ventured deep into the crypts of Shurima. There she was bitten and transformed into a viper-like predator. Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze (I see what you did there, Riot Games!).<br>
                            Just like Medusa in Smite, Cassiopeia’s ultimate ability stuns enemy that are facing her.<br><br>
                            The name Cassiopeia also comes from Greek mythology, since it's the name of a queen. More on that in a coming blog on Perseus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hades:</b><br>
                            A more comedic depiction of Medusa can be found in the game Hades. Here a floating Gorgon head can be found by the name Dusa.<br>
                            There's are hints in Dusa's backstory, which might imply that she is indeed the famous Medusa, although her backstory feels incomplete and vague.<br><br>
                            We will explore Hades more in a later blog!
