                        <p>So, it’s time to talk about one of my favorite stories in Greek mythology. But first I should introduce the main cast to you:</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hades:</b><br>
                            Brother of Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera and Hestia and king of the Underworld? That should ring a bell right?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the fall of the Titan Cronus, his kingdom was divided under his sons. So Hades got to rule over the Underworld. There he ruled with his queen Persephone, his niece..
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Hades was the god of the dead and the Underworld, but not the god of death! (That role is fulfilled by Thanatos). He was also the god of wealth and riches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hades is also known for his three headed dog Fluf… Cerberus, and his helmet of invisibility which was made by the Cyclopes during the war against the Titans (This is starting to feel like a certain book series).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In modern culture Hades is often depicted as some kind of villain or antagonist. But he was actually one of the least troublesome of the Olympians and faithful to his wife (pretty cool guy, seeing as he was a brother of Zeus and Poseidon).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hades is often depicted with his dog Cerberus, ‘the fruit of the dead’ the pomegranate, and together with his wife Persephone.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Demeter:</b><br>
                            Demeter was the goddess of agriculture and thus very important to the Greeks. She also became the most important goddess of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult that hoped to grant themselves the right to enter a special place in the Underworld, Elysium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She is also known for throwing children into fire to make them immortal, and failing because she got interrupted (Hey Demophoön, are you alright little buddy?). And teaching Triptolemus, Demophoön's elder brother, how to plant crops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She is often depicted holding the Cornucopia or a sheaf of grain, and overall she was a pretty cool goddess if you ask me!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Persephone:</b><br>
                            Ah, Persephone. Daughter of Demeter and Zeus (yes, brother and sister..) and the goddess of spring and growth.<br>
                            Wait… that doesn’t sound like a goddess that was feared more than the god of the Underworld himself?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Persephone’s original name was Kore, meaning “young girl” or “maiden” (guess Hades isn’t maidenless). After the kidnapping she took on the name Persephone, which means “to destroy” or “to bring death” (ah, there we go), since she had become a goddess of death and queen of the Underworld.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though her arrival to the underworld wasn’t the greatest thing ever, she took on her new role wholeheartedly, becoming known as the Dread Goddess. She also still was the goddess of spring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Persephone is often depicted holding a flaming torch and/or sheaves of grain and overall is a super badass goddess!
                        </p>
                        <h2>The story you need to know:</h2>
                        <p>Hades first appeared before Persephone in a field. She had been picking flowers until the ground opened up and Hades pulled her into his chariot. In an instant they were back underground, her cries only heard by the goddess Hecate.</p>
                        <p>Hades felt like he had the right to do this since Persephone’s father, Zeus himself, had given him permission. However, they both knew Demeter would never allow this, so they simply didn’t (what a wonderful world...).</p>
                        <p>
                            You can probably imagine how Demeter felt about all this.
                            At first she had no idea what had happened to her daughter. She searched for nine days, without eating or drinking anything. At that point she met with the goddess Hecate, who told her she had heard Persephone when she was taken but had no idea who had done it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Together they went to the Titan Helios, the god who brings the sun across the sky each day. He told Demeter it had been Hades. Helios also told her it was done with the permission of Zeus.
                            This news made Demeter furious, and who wouldn’t be. Not only was her daughter kidnapped by one of her brothers, Zeus had given permission to do so!
                            She was determined not to return to Olympus and her rage and despair affected the earth itself.
                            Crops died and the earth grew dry and barren.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her search brought her to the city Eleusis and became the nurse to the king’s family's new baby, Demophoön. She grew to love him so much that she couldn’t bear the idea he would eventually die.
So, she decided to make the child immortal by placing him in the embers of the fire every night.
Demophoön’s mother witnessed this and screamed out of fear.
Demeter then left Eleusis in anger, and the people built a temple for her in an attempt to appease her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During this time the earth was still… very dead. Demeter refused every attempt of Zeus to bring life back to the earth. She first wanted her daughter back by her side. Eventually Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but before he did Hades had fed her some pomegranate seeds.
Having eaten the fruit of the Underworld, Persephone was forced to split her time between her mother and her new husband.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is how the Greeks tried to understand the changing of the seasons and why Persephone is also associated with spring. She would spend one third of the year in the Underworld, and her mother would miss her so much that everything died, and two third of the year with the other Olympians and her mother.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Persephone and Hades didn’t have any kids, althoug some sources say they are the parents of the harpies.
                            She did have children by her father Zeus (yikes...).
                        </p>
